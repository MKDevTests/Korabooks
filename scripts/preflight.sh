# Pre-release sanity checks. Run before (and ideally as the first step of)
# release-kora.sh. Catches the recurring footguns that have eaten release
# cycles in the past:
#
#   - Last SQL migration not registered in AppMigrations.kt's hardcoded
#     list (V61 burned us once; V62 was a near-miss).
#   - JNI libs missing in a fresh worktree (libsqlitejdbc / libvips).
#   - Tag already published on GitHub (the v1.0.1 / v1.0.2 dance).
#   - Working tree dirty under the CRLF + submodule noise typical of
#     Windows / WSL checkouts on /mnt/c.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — ready to release
#   1 — at least one blocking problem
#   2 — usage error
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/preflight.sh <version>     # e.g. 1.0.3
#
# Most checks are belt-and-braces with release-kora.sh: that script also
# enforces branch + clean tree + tag uniqueness. Preflight adds the new
# checks (JNI, migration registry, optional TODO/FIXME scan) and is also
# usable standalone, e.g. before opening a PR.
